 * Passthrough for the `Nothing` variety of the `Maybe` [Crocks Algebraic Data Type](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/)
 * _(Copyright Â© 2016, Ian Hofmann-Hicks, ISC license)_
 *
 * See [https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Maybe.html](https://crocks.dev/docs/crocks/Maybe.html) for more details.
 *
 * Allows users of `elv-js-helpers` to create `Nothing` objects without adding the [Crocks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crocks)
 * package as a dependency.
 *
 * There are 2 kinds of `Maybe` objects, `Just` and `Nothing`, that wrap successful and failed value retrievals, respectively.
 *
 * `Maybe` objects are useful for handling errors in Functional pipelines where a value may not be found.
 *
 * Normally, one does not create generic `Maybe` object instances, but rather `Just` or `Nothing` instances.
 *
 * @function
 * @category ADT
 * @sig () -> Nothing
 * @returns {Maybe}
 * @example
 *
 * const Nothing = require('@eluvio/elv-js-helpers/ADT/Nothing')
 *
 * Nothing().inspect()    //=> 'Nothing'
 *
 * Nothing(42).inspect()    //=> 'Nothing'
